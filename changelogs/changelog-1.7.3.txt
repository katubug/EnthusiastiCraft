[1.7.3] 

I'm sorry to say that this update will again override client options, in order to force the correct keybinds and hide the attack indicator beneath the crosshair.
 
Mod Additions/Removals/Updates: 
- Removed Bloodmoon. It was added by mistake because I am really good at things.
- Added Animania and CraftStudioAPI.
- Added ItemZoom.
- Updated Nutrition to 4.4.0.
- Updated CreativeCore to 1.9.67.
- Updated Cyclic to 1.19.17.
- Updated Fossils and Archaeology to 8.0.3.
- Updated LittleTiles to 1.5.0.-pre167.
- Updated OnlinePictureFrame to 1.4.28.
- Updated Ore Excavation to 1.4.143.
- Updated UniDict to 2.9.3.
- Updated The Betweenlands to 3.4.12.
- Updated Ice and Fire to 1.8.2.
- Updated Immersive Engineering to 0.12-92.
- Updated WanionLib to 2.3.
 
Configs/Quests/Compatibility: 
- Lag warnings have been added to a handful of items, to help players keep their worlds running smoothly.
- The default keybinding for Inventory Sorting has been changed to ";" (semicolon) because it apparently activates even when one's inventory is closed, and having it bound to "S" was conflicting.
- The attack-cooldown crosshair has been disabled, as it was not being used.
- The following configs have been changed to no longer expect integration with mods not in the pack: Thermal Expansion, Cyclic, Chisel, and PlusTiC.
- The following animals now spawn in more fitting biomes: Gorillas, Macaws, Lions, Orcas, Albatrosses, Leopards, Condors, Elephants, Tigers, Rhinos, and Zebras.
- Nature's Compass has been changed to correctly hide Betweenlands Biomes, and the JEID error biome placeholder.
- A fair number of Chisel and Unlimited Chisel Works blocks can now be used to make Platforms.
- There is a small chance that if a pregnant Animania creature is not properly fed or watered, it will lose its pregnancy. This should help with overbreeding issues.
- Animania's Ferrets, Hamsters, Hedgehogs, and Rabbits can now sleep on beds.
- Peacocks and Chickens will now try to sleep in their nests.
- Seeds to feed Chickens/Peacocks with must be placed by crouching and right-clicking, to prevent accidental seed placement.
- Vanilla animals now have a small chance to drop Prime meats.
- Pigs have a small chance to drop their hoarded truffles upon death.
- Animania foods have had their hunger/saturation values brought in line with the rest of the pack.
- Ore Dictionary Entries have been added to all applicable Unlimited Chisel Works blocks.
- Flight is now possible in all dimensions when the Precious Emerald is in a player's inventory. It is crafted with an Emerald, a Twilight Forest Thorns block, and Swamp Viscera.
- The Primordial Malevolence now drops a new item - Swamp Viscera. This can be used to craft the Precious Emerald.
- Gravel Beaches now generate on more cold biomes, to make Naga easier to find.
- Wings from the Wings mod have had their durabilities made consistent across all types. They now have the same durability as Cyclic's Air Charm.
- Wings from the Wings mod now consume about half as much hunger. This may be adjusted in the future.
- Because of these significant buffs, Fairy Dust Ore now spawns significantly less often.
- The following items have been added to the Farming for Blockheads Market: Treasure 2's Spanish Moss, Twilight Forest's Moss Patch, Animania's Random Spawn Eggs.
- Fixed an issue where OpenBlocks Tanks were mistakenly hidden from JEI.
- To make TexFix compatible with the modlist, FoamFix's config has been changed to disable the "dynamicItemModels" option.

 
Server Changelog: 
- We've changed the server container to use Java HotSpot instead of OpenJ9, and our JVM arguments have also changed. This will hopefully result in increased performance.
