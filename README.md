# EnthusiastiCraft
EnthusiastiCraft is a modpack that aims to deliver a fun, immersive experience for adventurers,
builders, gardeners, and more! It's main focus keywords are: quality of life, aesthetic, exploration,
reward, and performance.

You can find more information on [the website](http://enthusiasticraft.cf/).

# Download
The modpack can be found [here on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enthusiasticraft). Not that I think anyone would bother rehosting this, but just in case: don't download this pack from anywhere other than CF as I cannot vouch for its authenticity.

# Roadmap
The future of this modpack is roughly plotted out [here on my Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/giCOx95W/230ad0de7b82010cd130cb4253026edf/enthusiasticraft).
