# EnthusiastiCraft
EnthusiastiCraft is a modpack that aims to deliver a fun, immersive experience for adventurers,
builders, gardeners, and more! It's main focus keywords are: quality of life, aesthetic, exploration,
reward, and performance.

The modpack can be found here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enthusiasticraft

# This GitHub
I am still working on integrating the actual modpack files such as configs etc with github. As of now,
this is primarily to provide a place for bug reports and other feedback.
