Configs/Quests/Compatibility: 
[10/20/19]
- JEI has been configured to show liquids. This may be disabled if desired.
- Fixed an issue where the guidebook was broken.
- Adjusted ZAWA spawning biomes for the following creatures: Gaur, Anaconda, Gharial, Pangolin, Giant Salamander, Koala, Meerkat, Hippopotamus, Okapi, Pufferfish, Walrus, Kangaroo, Red Panda, Giraffe, Salmon, Toucan, Tree Frogs, Sea Turtles, Fish. This should represent the whole roster - if any animals spawn outside of expected biome types, please report.
[10/12/19]
- The Nature's Compass config has been changed to use biome names instead of numerical IDs. Additionally, biomes from The Erebus dimension are blacklisted.
- Rotten Wood from the Erebus will no longer be rounded via BetterFoliage.
- Crops from Erebus (and other recently-added mods) should now be harvestable with right-click.
- Random Tool Kit's Fourier Transformer and Barometer have been disabled.
- Sirens now fascinate targets for a shorter period of time, with a longer cooldown. This is to prevent people getting stuck on terrain while attacked.
- The Drawer Controller can now reach up to 20 drawers in any direction instead of only 12.
- Drawers will now show their stored quantity by default.
- Crops from Mystical World and Roots are now compatible with AgriCraft crop sticks.
-- Aubergines may be grown on most types of (nonmagical) soil.
-- Wildroot, Wildewheet, Spirit Herbs, and Pereskia may only be grown on Roots' magical soils.
-- Infernal Bulbs, Dewgonia, Cloud Berries, and Stalicripe may only be grown on their respective elemental soil type.
-- Be aware that the bonuses usually granted by the different soils do not apply to crops grown on Crop Sticks.
-- Bone meal can be used on Aubergines, but all the crops from Roots cannot be bonemealed.
- Ender Compasses must now be in one's inventory in order to work.
- With the removal of TexFix, FoamFix's "dynamicItemModels" has been reenabled.
- JEI/JER should now have more accurate information about where ores and such can be found.
- Natura's Saguaro Cactuses should now spawn more frequently.
[10/22/19]
- Fixed an issue where Undead Rising's Lava Cows weren't spawning.
 
Server Changelog: 
- Reverted JVM arguments to completely default, as previous ones may not have been significantly helping.
- Portal hub at spawn is now in working order!
- Rank promotions are now automatic again thanks to the PlayerActivity mod. They may behave weirdly until I get everyone's data re-entered, however.
