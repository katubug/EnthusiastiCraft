FoamFix - 
 - Barring more crash bugs, this is probably the final FoamFix release for 1.12.2.

Mystic World - 
 - New entity: Silkworm! These do not spawn natively in the world. Instead, you may find silkworm eggs when breaking tall grass (like seeds), or breaking leaves (like saplings). Silkworm eggs have a 30% chance to spawn a silkworm, which will wobble around growing until it plops out a Silk Coccoon. You can drop leaves (as items) near the silkworm in order to speed up the process; in addition, the more leaves they eat, the higher the chance they will drop additional cocoons.
 - New items: silk cocoon, silk thread & spindle: you can directly convert silk cocoons into silk thread (an alternative to string) in a somewhat lossy fashion, or you can craft a spindle and combine the cocoon with the spindle: you will gain considerably more return, although the spindle will take some damage.
 - Materials have been greatly improved and conditional registration has been removed. Now, ore dictionary registration, ore spawning and recipes will be enabled or disabled instead.
 - Fix #53: Repair items are now properly set for Amethyst, Copper and Silver tools.
 - There is now an option to give the player (true by default) the Mystical World Patchouli Guide.
 - Baked models have been replaced with standard Minecraft blockstate files, preventing future issues with Patchouli visualisations & Direwolf's Building Gadget.
 - Mystical World entities no longer return "false" by default to "isAIDisabled".
 - Patchouli: Amethyst, Copper and Silver entries are now conditionally displayed depending on whether or not they are enabled.
 - Patchouli: All entity pages will display conditionally determined by whether or not the entity's spawn is enabled.
 - It is no longer possible to disable Sprouts, as these entities are essential to Roots. They will be moved into Roots at a later date.
 - Fix #57: ores now generation in dimensions specified in a whitelist in the config.
 - Properly add Aubergines to the Just Enough Resources integration (instead of having it be in Roots)
 - Improved the Standard Drops interface for Patchouli for Silkworm and Lava Cats (Silkworm currently unused)
 - Added loot tables for silkworms and lava cats: silkworms have a chance to drop eggs, obsidian cats drop cobble and have a chance to drop obsidian
 - Fix similar issue with Squid cooldowns (from bottling ink) potentially causing crashes with the new animal cooldown capability.

MysticalLib - 
 - This mod is now compiled against the latest version of Forge for 1.12.2, 2847.
 - Properly annotate functions with @Override
 - ItemUtil functions to fetch ItemStacks from BlockStates and vice versa.
 - Adjusted the size of leaf particles to prevent Mip-Map errors.
 - Fix Roots #221: baffle-cap mushroom blocks use the wood sound instead of hte stone sound.
 - Hopefully fix situations where high values of fortune can result in 0 drops being made from ore blocks (such as Amethyst Ore).
 - New system for handling handing-out-books-upon-login that can be extended by other mods.
 - New system for dynamically generating blockstate files for various block types: "block", "button", "double_slab", "fence", "fence_gate", "pressure_plate", "slab", "stairs", "wall" -- multi-texture blocks (log, door, trapdoor) coming soon.
 - Moved the entity cooldown capability serialisation into the base code to prevent duplication of effort.

OreLib - 
 - Fixes Client compatibility with Advanced Rocketry. Addresses crash with Dynamic Surroundings.

RandomPatches - 
 - Temporary fix for SpongeForge compatibility.
 - Fixed compatibility between the smooth eye level change animation and Valkyrien Skies.
 - Fixed Ice and Fire compatibility.
 - Added a fix for MC-5694, which causes fast mining to sometimes only destroy blocks client-side only.
 - Added a fix for MC-54026, which causes blocks attached to slime blocks in some circumstances to create ghost blocks if a piston pushes the slime block.
 - The Dismount keybind no longer displays as conflicting with the Sneak keybind.
 - The Dismount keybind is now enabled by default.

Roots - 
 - Hopefully fix an unexpected but should-have-expected-it bug with the change to Runic Shears that caused crashes and/or the shears to simply not function.
 - Fix a misunderstanding that RenderHelper.drawEntity is not GuiScreenInventory.drawEntityOnScreen. Don't code tired!
 - Fix an unexpected interaction with Tinker's Tool Leveling that caused a crash during initialisation.
 - Properly import the commit that instated JER integration with elemental soils.
 - Added Lava Cat & Silkworm to the animal harvest ritual (see Mystical World 1.4.6)
 - The mod is now built against the latest version of Forge for 1.12, 2947.
 - Fix #241: Geas has no effect on creatures.
 - Translated Geas, Invulnerability & Time Stop into potion effects away from the effects manager; removed the effects manager bloat.
 - Fix #237: Tall flowers spawned by Grove Stones will no longer void blocks above them.
 - Fix #240: Iced Touch & Frost Lands no longer convert flowing liquid into solid variants.
 - Fix #236: Localisation for the Touch module.
 - Fix #230: Overgrowth now works with all suitable targets for moss conversion.
 - The Grove Stone is now a multipart model; hopefully this will resolve some shadow issues that users have with Optifine. In addition, it now has proper bounding boxes.
 - It is now possible to visualise all rituals that have a multiblock structure.
 - Hand animations now play when using Runic Shears on entities.
 - Fix #271: remove debug statements from the Flower Growth ritual.
 - Fix #268: extend the /ritual command to cover large quantities of ritual stones.
 - Fix #267: give back dirt when swapping farmland for elemental soil.
 - Fix #266: the Sure-Footed Stone is no longer converted to stone with lava, nor can it be removed with a bucket. It can be voided by a sponge, however, and there's no way around that: this is now a feature!
 - Fix #214: Buff the Purity ritual to no longer cleanse hostile creatures. This allows for its improvement of the speed of the Zombie Villager conversion to happen without removing the weakness debuff.
 - Added utilities for entities.
 - Fey leather is now in the ore dictionary under the entry "leather".
 - Fix #298: The wording of the Elemental Soil entry has been updated to indicate that elemental soil must be throw into the top of a block of lava, rather than the sides.
 - Adjusted some Mortar recipes in light of changes to Mystical World; added additional Mortar recipes for: orange dye (carrots), string x 3 (wool), string x 5 (silkworm cocoon), blaze powder x 5 (blaze rod).
 - Buffed the output of petal production from double-tall flowers. It is no longer possible to combine single flowers with double-tall flowers in the Mortar.
 - The are no longer conflicting/doubled recipes for smelting iron & gold dust into their equivalent ingots; this is handled in Mystical World.
 - Fix #296: Knives can now be used in dispensers. When provided with a redstone signal, they will attempt to scrape moss from the block they are facing; if successful, the knife will be damaged, and terra moss will be spawned the block above the dispenser.
 - Time conditions are deprecated for now and will not likely make a return until the Twilight Grove is implemented.
 - The Overgrowth Ritual now happens twice as fast, but producing the same amount of Terra Moss.
 - The Elemental Soil recipe in the Fey Crafter now produces 4 elemental soil for each craft, rather than 1.
 - The Infernal Bulb recipe now requires Wildroot, Magma Cream, Gunpowder, a Lava Bucket and Glowstone; this means that a Nether trip is still required, but finding a Nether Fortress is no longer required; in addition, you can convert Magma Blocks into Magma Creams in a Mortar.
 - The Bonfire no longer consumes fire but speeds up its decay.
 - Petal Shell now functions as a Potion Effect, and its rendering has returned (although not as pretty as previously).
 - Fix #283: check to see if blocks can sustain plants before planting them.
 - The Wild Growth ritual now requires any bark + dark oak bark, instead of normal oak bark.
 - The Windwall Ritual now uses EntityUtil to determine if things are hostile.
 - Radiance no longer requires Infernal Bulb, but instead uses Cloud Berry (it makes more sense that it would be closer to the sun than closer to the Nether, in that it does holy damage). This means that only 1 of the 2 current damaging ranged spells is locked behind the Nether.
 - Transmutation Ritual: Cocoa crop can now be converted to carrots (as items); fully-grown carrot crops will be converted into newly-planted beetroot. As Cocoa beans can be obtained through the ritual already, this removes the necessity of finding a village for beetroots (and pereskia).
 - Transmutaiton Ritual: Carpet placed over water (it can be done!) can be converted to lily pads; trapdoors placed on top of any wool block will be converted to cobwebs; redstone placed on top of leaf blocks will be converted into vines.
 - Heights (based on the defaults) are specified in the Patchouli documentation for elemental soils (air and earth).
 - Significant changes to spell recipes. Some have been made considerably easier to obtain, while others have been made slightly more complex. Bone meal has been removed from recipes that it is not appropriate for. Changes:
 -- Acid Cloud now require Spider Eye, Baffle-Cap Mushroom, Lime Dye, Cactus Block and Rotten Flesh
 -- Dandelion Winds now requires Dandelion, any Leaves, Runic Dust, Cloud Berry and Terra Spores.
 -- Fey Light now requires Lit Pumpkin, Sunflower, Cloud Berry, Cloud Berry and Acacia Bark. (Note: Sunflowers can be easily obtained through the growth function of the Grove Stone).
 -- Geas now requires Cobweb (obtained via the Transmutation Ritual & shears), a Lead, Carrot-on-a-Stick, Terra Spores, Baffle-Cap Mushroom
 -- Harvest now requires Golden Hoe, Aubergine Seeds, Wildewheet, Beetroot Seeds and Wheat Seeds
 -- Iced Touch now requires Dewgonia, Snow, Snow Layer, Snow Ball and Blue Orchid (which can be obtained through the Flower Growth ritual)
 -- Life Drain now requires Baffle-Cap Mushroom, Moonglow Leaf, Moonglow Seads, Iron Sword and Block Cactus
 -- Light Drifter's cooldown has been increased to 250, but its duration is now 200. It requires Ender Pearl, Moonglow Leaf, Sunflower (obtained through the Grove Stone), Yellow Dye and Wildewheet.
 -- Magnetism now requires Iron Ingot, Redstone Dust, Paper, Wildroot and Aubergine
 -- Petal Shell now requires Petals, Aubergine, Spirit Herb, Shield and Pereskia
 -- Rampant Growth now requires Any Sapling, Golden Apple, Any Sapling, Spirit Herb, Pereskia
 -- Rose Thorns now requires Cactus Block, Rose Bush, Bone, Rose Red, Terra Moss
 -- Sanctuary now requires Armor Stand, Pereskia, Milk Bucket, Spruce Bark and Wildroot
 -- Sense Animals now requires Carrot, Lead, Wildewheet, Wheat and Gold Nugget
 -- Sense Danger now requires Gold Nugget, Compass, Spider Eye, any Bark, Aubergine
 -- Shatter now requires Flint, Stone Pickaxe, Stalicripe, TNT block and Cobblestone
 -- Sky Soarer now requires Ladder, Petals, Arrow, Aubergine Seed and Cloud Berry
 -- Time Stop now requires Ender Pearl, Moonglow Leaf, Potion of Slowness (base duration), Pereskia and Clock
 -- Wildfire now requires Orange Dye, Charcoal, Gunpowder, Infernal Bulb, TNT Block
 - Animal Harvest will now have a chance to, if there is a suitable source block of water, spawn fish in it. Fish spawn according to the default weights outlined in the loot table for fishing, and can be adjusted through CraftTweaker.
 - When extinguishing Pyres with a bucket of water (or whatever) in creative mode, the bucket will not itself by drained.
 - Fix #173: continue to refill Pyres with appropriate ingredients following a server restart.
 - Fix #273: don't override the "id" tag when serialising ritual entities. This prevents ritual entities from being discarded following server restarts.
 - Fix #260: Ritual of Gathering now places ingredients into the first inventory found in a 3x3 around the Pyre.
 - When failing to start a ritual, you will now be given an informative message as to what actually failed.
 - There is now an option (default false) to give players the Roots Patchouli Guide when starting a new game.
 - Wildwood Fence Gates are now a thing! In addition, all blocks have been converted from baked models into standard Minecraft blockstates. This should resolve all issues with Patchouli visualisation and Direwolf's Building Gadgets.
 - Fix #282: The Component Pouch is now specifically mentioned in the spell section of the Patchouli guide.
 - Fix #279: If you have no component pouch, the message specifically states that you require one to store your components, instead of saying "Not enough of X herb".
 - Fix #276: The Fey Crafter now accepts any type of sapling instead of only oak saplings.
 - Fey Crafter: the JEI transfer-from-inventory button will now function properly with the last slot of the hotbar.
 - Fix #281: Container items used in the Mortar, Fey Crafter & Pyre are now properly emptied and returned, instead of being destroyed.
 - Fix #310: if the Fey Crafter can't be activated with a knife, instead open the GUI.
 - The Fey Crafter crafting visual is now more appropriately coloured.
 - Fix #311: Improve handling of animal cooldown capabilities: when loading from a save file, actually set the cooldown value to its previous number, instead of adding it. This means that it is possible to re-shear entities between sessions.
 - Fix #234: Using the Runic Shears on a suitable mossy (or state that can be converted to mossy) block will attempt to shear all suitable blocks in a 5x5 radius around it for Terra Moss.
 - Work on #197: added sections for Standing Stones & Ritual Automation with explanations of how these work. In addition, all entries for Rituals using Standing Stones have a link to those standing stones at the bottom of the first page.
 - Fix #258: there is now JEI support for entities and Runic Shears. It should automatically fill in the details, with the cooldown being displayed in the item tooltip. Scaling and positioning not guaranteed to be functional for every entity in-game.
 - Fix #308: the size of the GUI is now adjusted depending on being Apothecary Pouch or Component Pouch; unfortunately the positioning is a little off, but it should prevent strange overlap.
 - Thanks to Davoleo, we now have an Italian translation!
 - Bats have been removed from the default list of Pacifist animals, as they are sometimes too easy to accidentally kill; silkworms and lava cats have been added.
 - Fix a bug with Wild Growth ritual not working.
 - Added a recipe for stuffed aubergine using roasted pereskia bulbs
 - Modified Sky Soarer to continue momentum after the spell ends. This will make using it while riding horses or boats feel much smoother

Broken Wings - 
 - add the ability to set metadata on whitelist items
 - add the ability to set whitelist items only for a particular dimension - Check GitHub readme
 - add countermeasure for wings from the Wings mod
 
===================================== 
 
 
﻿[1.7.3] 

I'm sorry to say that this update will again override client options, in order to force the correct keybinds and hide the attack indicator beneath the crosshair.

Configs/Quests/Compatibility: 
- Lag warnings have been added to a handful of items, to help players keep their worlds running smoothly.
- The default keybinding for Inventory Sorting has been changed to ";" (semicolon) because it apparently activates even when one's inventory is closed, and having it bound to "S" was conflicting.

- The following configs have been changed to no longer expect integration with mods not in the pack: Thermal Expansion, Cyclic, Chisel, and PlusTiC.
- The following animals now spawn in more fitting biomes: Gorillas, Macaws, Lions, Orcas, Albatrosses, Leopards, Condors, Elephants, Tigers, Rhinos, and Zebras.

- To make TexFix compatible with the modlist, FoamFix's config has been changed to disable the "dynamicItemModels" option.

 
Server Changelog:

 - The Lich Shields syncs a little better between the server and client.

Added Zoo and Wild Animals Rebuilt.

Default keybindings for most keys have been changed to overlap less. Many keys have been unbound entirely. This can all be changed in the Options menu. New installs will not be affected, and future modpack updates will not overwrite existing settings.
The default model for the Brewing Stand has been changed to a Cauldron using this texture pack: https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/cauldron-for-brewing-potions/files/2722316. This can be changed by unloading the appropriate resource pack.
Because Animania has been removed for compatibility purposes, the following changes have taken place:

— The recipe for Angel Rings now requires Pixie Dust (any) instead of Peacock Feathers.
The recipe for Infinity Booster Cards has been changed to require 2 Quantum Entangled Singularities and a Wireless Receiver.

Potions, Splash Potions, and Lingering Potions all stack to 16.
The Magnet from EnderIO now goes in the Belt slot to avoid conflict with the Heart Amulet.

EnderIO’s teleportation items will no longer allow players to teleport out of Compact Machines.
Recipes have been added for Applied Energistics 2’s Inscriber Presses.

Entering the Betweenlands should no longer throw a bunch of BetterFoliage errors.
Rubber Chickens now lay Tiny Dry Rubber instead of Plastic.
Dry Rubber and Tiny Dry Rubber are now compatible with Compacting Drawers.
Thermal Foundation’s Coins have been added to the list of possible Bounties.

Quark’s Crystal Caves now spawn more often, and can be found in the Mining Dimension and the Twilight Forest.
Spirit Trees in Bonsai Pots now only produce one type of log.
Spirit Trees in Bonsai Pots will now produce the middle and bottom sections of their leaves.
Removed even more unnecessary values from Biomes O Plenty’s configs.
Pam’s Harvestcraft trees have had their Bonsai behavior changed: instead of dropping logs, sticks, leaves, and having a small chance to drop fruit, they now drop only fruit, but at a 100% success rate.
AE2 Wireless Crafting Terminals only require 1 Infinity Booster that is not consumed. As a result, Infinity Boosters are now more expensive to craft. Their drop rate from mobs has not been changed.

Basic and Framed Storage Drawers have had additional recipes added (they can only be combined, they cannot be separated once crafted):

— Four 1×1 Drawers = One 2×2 Drawer
— Half Drawers have not been included in this change.
Pig Slop now accepts Pam’s Fresh Milk x4 in place of a bucket of milk. It still requires a bucket, however – no free buckets for you.
The following soils can now hold crop sticks: Loamy Farmland, Silty Farmland, Sandy Farmland. Any crop capable of growing on regular farmland should be compatible with these soils.
The following plants can now be planted on crop sticks: Rustic’s Aloe Vera, Blood Orchid, Chamomile, Chili Pepper, Cloudsbluff, Cohosh, Core Root, Deathstalk Mushrooms, Ginseng, Grapes, Horsetail, Marsh Mallow, Mooncap Mushroom, Tomato, Wind Thistle. Grapes will look a little funny when fully grown – there’s nothing I can do about this. The mushrooms can be grown on either regular soil or mycelium. They do not require darkness to grow, as Rustic itself doesn’t require them to be in the darkness. Rustic plants do not have mutations at this time.
Biomes O’Plenty’s soils have all been given the “dirt” Ore Dictionary tag.
RandomThings’ Fertilized Dirt now accepts any soil in the “dirt” Ore Dictionary tag.
Rustic’s Fertile Soil now accepts any soil in the “dirt” Ore Dictionary tag.

Fertile Soil can now be upgraded to Fertilized Dirt via either Rotten Flesh or Fertilizer.
Filled vanilla Buckets now no longer craft shapelessly into Tar Drops (except when filled with Tar).
Tar items from varying mods can now be crafted into one another.
Consoles will no longer report “Cascading world gen.” This can be changed in forge.cfg.
“Gravity” effect has been disabled from Infernal Mobs due to occasional bugginess.
Vanilla animals now have a rare chance of dropping Animania’s Prime meats.
Animania animals have had a few changes:
— Particle effects are disabled.
— They can now breed autonomously as long as their needs are met.
— Chickens and Peacocks now prefer to sleep in their nests. Otherwise, they will sleep on grass.
— Pigs now have a small chance of dropping their hoarded truffles upon death.
— Animania animals can still gorge themselves on your gardens, but it will no longer destroy the crops.
— Gestation times have been halved and baby animals grow up faster.
— Animals will now go longer without becoming thirsty.
To avoid a conflict with MoarSigns, Quark’s better sign editing has been disabled.
Quark’s Wither Ash and NetherEx’s Wither Dust have both been disabled.
Due to causing crashes, Reliquary’s Mob Charms have been removed and had their recipes disabled.
Fixed a recipe conflict with Rustic’s crop Stakes and Quark’s Vertical Planks.
Fixed a recipe conflict with Inspirations’ Mulch, Biomes O’Plenty’s Bamboo Thatching, and AgriCraft’s Crop Sticks.
