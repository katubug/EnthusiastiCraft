It is recommended that you have a look at the $(place)Controls menu$() and decide how you would like to customize your hotkeys. $(italic)Controlling$() makes this easier by adding the $(thing)ability to search for a specific keybind$(), and to show which ones may be conflicting, as well as which keys are currently free."

Additionally, the mod will consider $(item)'H'$() and $(item)'Shift+H'$() as a conflict, although the keybindings are technically different."
