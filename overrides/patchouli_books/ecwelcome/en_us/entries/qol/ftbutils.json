This will allow things to continue to work without you being close to them. This is particularly useful for items such as the $(item)Angel Ring$(), which requires power to function - you will no longer be tied to the area with your generator."

You may then claim chunks by $(action)left clicking on the map$(). Holding $(action)shift while you click$() will both claim and load the chunk. In order to unclaim a chunk, you must $(action)right-click$() it. Be aware that on servers, the amount of chunks you can claim and load may be limited, as $(bold)the amount of loaded chunks affects performance$()."

You can find the options for these in the $(place)upper left of your inventory screen$() nearby where the chunk claiming tool is located."
