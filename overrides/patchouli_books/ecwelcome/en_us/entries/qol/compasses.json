If the biome is within roughly 10,000 blocks, it will provide you with the coordinates. The $(item)Stronghold Compass$() does what the name suggests - if you are within 1,000 blocks of a $(thing)Stronghold$(), it will point you in its direction. Getting to $(place)The End$() has never been easier."
